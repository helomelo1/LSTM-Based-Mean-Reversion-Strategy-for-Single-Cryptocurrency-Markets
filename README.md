# LSTM-Based Quantitative Trading and Performance Evaluation System

## üìà Overview
This project implements a **deep learning‚Äìdriven framework** for trading strategy analysis.  
It leverages **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks** to forecast financial time series and generate trading signals, which are then evaluated through **robust backtesting**.  

The system produces essential performance metrics, including:

- **Sharpe Ratio**  
- **Volatility**  
- **Cumulative / Annualized Return**  
- **Maximum Drawdown**  
- **Turnover**

By integrating sequential deep learning with a professional backtesting engine, the system enables end-to-end strategy evaluation from **prediction to performance analysis**.

## üß© Features
- Train LSTM models on historical OHLC and technical indicator data  
- Generate daily trading signals (buy/sell/hold)  
- Backtest strategies using `backtesting.py` or `vectorbt`  
- Compute key performance metrics  
- Visualize equity curve, volatility, and drawdown  
- Modular design: plug in any model or trading rule
